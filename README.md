# hello

Temporary starter/learning repository, in order to get to grips
with ''git'' and **GitHub** on Mac OS X.

## C89/C99 Hello World

The idea is to create a “Hello, World!” program and use GitHub
actions to compile it. Ideally, this should be portable and use
a `Makefile` to compile for:

* MacOS
* Linux
* Windows
